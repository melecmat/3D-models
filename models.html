    <h1>3D Models [work in progress]</h1>
    <p>
        These models and their description are part of a historical heritage documentation project, undertaken jointly by
        the Czech National Heritage Fund and the Multi-Robot Systems group at FEE CTU, that investigates the possibility of 
        the deployment of small autonomous drones in the heritage documentation and restoration work.
        More information about this project can be found
        <a href="http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/projects/dronument" target="blank">here</a> or <a href="https://dronument.cz" target="blank">here</a> (Czech only).

        I implemented the 3D web viewer for annotate model, the code can be found here. <!--TODO LINK!--> The viewer is localised into
        3 languages: English, German and Czech, and supports switching between annotations in those languages. If anyone would benefit from
        a different language mutation, contact me, it can be added.
        Also for the annotation purposes I developed a cross-platform Electron app, that can also be used to optimize models for the use on 
        the web. The code, together with releases, is available here. <!--TODO LINK -->

        I also created some 3D models from the textured point clouds from scanners using a pipeline of open-source tools. As this
        process is time-consuming and error-prone, I wrote a small description of the pipeline together with Jan Bednář. (Czech only right now)
